# CAP theorem

## In Database theory

## Consistency

Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

## Availability

Every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a response.

## Partition tolerance

The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
